Tables and coding for my Massachusetts Education project

In this project, I used publicly-available datasets from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education from the year 2019.  Attached here are the cleaned data sets.  In addition, I have included my SQL coding used to validate the cleanliness of the data, and to make comparisons between districts in terms of demographics and number of students.  Additionally, I demonsrated in SQL how you can perform some regression analysis.
